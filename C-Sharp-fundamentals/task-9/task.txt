9. **Reflection and Custom AttributesObjective:Requirements:**
    - Build an application that discovers and executes methods based on custom attributes.
    - Define a custom attribute (e.g., `[Runnable]`).
    - Create several classes with methods decorated with the `[Runnable]` attribute.
    - Use reflection to scan the current assembly for methods marked with `[Runnable]`.
    - Invoke the discovered methods dynamically and display their outputs.
