7. **Asynchronous Programming and Multi-threadingObjective:Requirements:**
    - Develop a console application that performs multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.
    - Use `async` and `await` to fetch data from multiple simulated sources (e.g., using `Task.Delay` to mimic API calls).
    - Aggregate the results once all tasks are complete.
    - Handle exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations.
