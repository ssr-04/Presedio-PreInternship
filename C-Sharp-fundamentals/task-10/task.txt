10. **Building a Mini Microservice with ASP.NET CoreObjective:Requirements:**
    - Create a small RESTful API that manages a resource (e.g., Products, Orders, or Books) using ASP.NET Core.
    - **Project Setup:**
        - Set up a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.
        - Configure routing and controllers.
    - **Dependency Injection:**
        - Implement a service layer and register services using ASP.NET Coreâ€™s dependency injection.
    - **Data Access:**
        - Use Entity Framework Core with an in-memory database (or SQLite) to perform CRUD operations.
    - **Asynchronous Operations:**
        - Use `async`/`await` in your controller actions to handle database operations.
    - **Error Handling and Logging:**
        - Implement middleware or filters for global exception handling.
        - Integrate basic logging to record actions and errors.
    - **Testing and Documentation:**
        - Write unit tests for your controllers and services.
        - Document the API endpoints (using tools like Swagger).
    - **Advanced Considerations (Optional):**
        - Incorporate design patterns such as Repository and Unit of Work.
        - Implement custom middleware for request/response logging or authentication.
