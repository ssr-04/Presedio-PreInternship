**Delegates, Events, and Basic Event HandlingObjective:Requirements:**
- Build a console-based event-driven application (e.g., a counter that triggers an event at a threshold).
- Define a delegate and an event that fires when a counter reaches a specific value.
- Create multiple event handler methods that perform actions when the event is raised.
- In your main loop, increment the counter and raise the event when appropriate.
- Demonstrate how events can decouple the producer and consumer logic.
