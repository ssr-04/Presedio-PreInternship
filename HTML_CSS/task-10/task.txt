**Interactive Multi-Page Website Simulator with CSS Only**

- **Objective:** Create a fully functional, multi-section website that simulates the experience of navigating between different pages—all without any JavaScript.
- **Requirements:**
    - Use the `:target` pseudo-class to display and hide different “pages” or sections of content.
    - Incorporate CSS animations and transitions to simulate page transitions (such as fading or sliding effects).
    - Design an accessible navigation menu that works across different devices and screen sizes.
    - Ensure that the entire experience is responsive and leverages advanced CSS techniques (e.g., combining Flexbox, Grid, and pseudo-classes) to manage layout and state transitions.
