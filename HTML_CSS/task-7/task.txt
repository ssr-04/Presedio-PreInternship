**Pure CSS Carousel/Slider**
- **Objective:** Develop an image carousel that cycles through slides automatically and/or manually.
- **Requirements:**
    - Use CSS animations (`@keyframes`) to create an auto-sliding effect.
    - Implement manual slide selection using the `:checked` pseudo-class with hidden radio buttons or the `:target` pseudo-class.
    - Ensure that the slider is responsive and visually engaging.
