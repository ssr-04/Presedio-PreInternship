**Modal Popup Using the `:target` or Checkbox Hack**
- **Objective:** Build a modal (popup window) that opens and closes without JavaScript.
- **Requirements:**
    - Use an anchor link with an ID and the `:target` pseudo-class—or a hidden checkbox with the `:checked` pseudo-class—to control the modal’s visibility.
    - Style the modal to appear centered with an overlay backdrop.
    - Add CSS transitions for the modal’s appearance and disappearance.
