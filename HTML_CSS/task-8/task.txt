**CSS Accordion Component**
- **Objective:** Build an accordion where content sections expand and collapse on click.
- **Requirements:**
    - Use the checkbox hack (a hidden checkbox input with a label) or the `:target` pseudo-class to control the open/closed state of each section.
    - Apply CSS transitions to animate the expansion and collapse of content areas.
    - Allow multiple sections to be open simultaneously (if desired) or restrict it to one open section at a time.
