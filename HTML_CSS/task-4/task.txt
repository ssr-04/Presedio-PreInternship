**Pure CSS Dropdown Menu**
- **Objective:** Design a navigation bar with a dropdown submenu that appears on hover.
- **Requirements:**
    - Use nested `<ul>` elements for the menu and submenu.
    - Employ CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover` and transitions to create a smooth reveal effect.
    - Ensure that the menu looks good on both desktop and mobile (consider using a responsive fallback).
