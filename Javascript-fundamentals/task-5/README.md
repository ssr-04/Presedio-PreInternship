## ‚úÖ How the Code Meets the Task Requirements  

| **Task Requirement** | **Implementation in Code** |  
|----------------------|---------------------------|  
| **Store quiz questions and options in a JavaScript object or load them from an external JSON file.** | Quiz questions are stored in a separate **`data.js` file** and imported as a module. This modular approach ensures scalability and easy updates. |  
| **Use event listeners to capture user selections and move through quiz questions.** | Click events handle **answer selection, navigation between questions, and quiz submission**. Selected answers are stored in an array for tracking. |  
| **Calculate and display the final score, providing feedback or explanations.** | The `submitQuiz()` function computes the **final score, percentage**, and presents **correct answers with explanations** for better learning. |

## üîß Application Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Loading Quiz Questions Dynamically**  
The application starts by loading questions and answer choices from the `data.js` file. The **`loadQuestion(index)`** function dynamically updates the **question container** and **options container**, ensuring only the relevant content is displayed.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling User Selection**  
Users select an answer by clicking on an option. The **`selectOption()`** function highlights the chosen option and updates the `userAnswers` array to store their response. If users navigate back, their previous selection is retained.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Navigating Between Questions**  
- The **"Next"** button ensures users cannot proceed without selecting an answer.  
- The **"Previous"** button allows revisiting previous questions while retaining selected answers.  
- The **"Submit"** button appears on the last question, allowing users to complete the quiz.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculating Score and Displaying Feedback**  
Once submitted, the quiz interface hides and the **final score** is displayed as a **percentage**. The app also provides:  
- **Correct and incorrect answers** for review.  
- **Explanations** for each question to help users understand their mistakes.
