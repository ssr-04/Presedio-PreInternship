# Interactive To-Do List Application

## 📌 Overview

This is a simple yet effective **To-Do List Application** that allows users to add, mark, and remove tasks. The app is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, utilizing **DOM manipulation** to handle interactions dynamically. It also leverages `localStorage` to persist tasks even after the page is refreshed.

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Add Tasks** – Users can enter a new task and add it to the list.  
✅ **Mark Tasks as Completed** – Clicking on a task will toggle its completion status (crossed-out text).  
✅ **Delete Tasks** – Users can remove a task by clicking the delete (`X`) button.  
✅ **Keyboard Support** – Pressing the `Enter` key also adds tasks.  
✅ **Local Storage** – Tasks persist even after a page refresh.

5. Tasks are **stored** in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the application.
- **CSS** – Styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and logic handling.
- **LocalStorage** – Task persistence.

## 🔧 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository** (if hosted on GitHub):
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
3. **Open `index.html` in a browser**:
   - Double-click the `index.html` file.
