**Weather App with API Integration**
- **Objective:** Create a weather app that fetches and displays weather information based on a city name input.
- **Requirements:**
    - Use the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
    - Parse the JSON response and update the DOM with temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
    - Implement error handling for invalid input or failed network requests.
