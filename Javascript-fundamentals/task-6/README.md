# 📝 **Drag and Drop List Reordering**  

## 📌 **Overview**  

This **Drag and Drop List Reordering** application allows users to reorder list items by dragging and dropping them into a new position. It supports both **desktop drag-and-drop** functionality and **mobile touch-based dragging**, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.

## ✅ **How the Code Meets Task Requirements**  

| **Task Requirement** | **Implementation** |  
|----------------------|---------------------------|  
| **Leverage the HTML5 Drag and Drop API to manage drag events.** | The application uses `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`, `dragend`, `dragenter`, and `dragleave` events to handle reordering. |  
| **Update the DOM to reflect the new order of items after a drop.** | When an item is dropped, the **list is updated dynamically** by inserting the dragged item at the correct position. |  
| **Provide visual feedback during drag operations.** | The `.dragging` class reduces opacity and scales the item slightly, while `.over` highlights the drop target. |

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  

- **HTML5** – Defines the list structure with draggable elements.  
- **CSS3** – Styles the list, enhances visual feedback during dragging, and ensures responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Implements drag-and-drop logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

## 🔧 **Application Workflow**  

### 1️⃣ **Handling Drag Events (Desktop)**  
- The user clicks and **drags a list item**, triggering `dragstart()`, which:  
  - Stores the dragged item.  
  - Adds the `.dragging` class for **visual feedback**.  
- As the item is moved, `dragover()` and `dragenter()` allow drop targets to highlight.  
- When dropped, `drop()` places the item in its new position and updates the list.  

### 2️⃣ **Handling Touch Events (Mobile)**  
- The app also supports **touch-based interactions**, using `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend`.  
- `touchmove()` detects movement and dynamically **reorders items**.  

### 3️⃣ **Updating the List Order**  
- The `insertAfterDraggedItem()` and `insertBeforeDraggedItem()` functions determine where to place the dragged item.  
- The new order is immediately reflected in the **DOM**, maintaining a seamless experience.
