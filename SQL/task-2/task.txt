2. **Basic Filtering and Sorting**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Write queries that filter records and sort the result set.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on a condition (e.g., `WHERE Department = 'Sales'`).
    - Apply the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results (e.g., by `LastName` or `Salary`).
    - Experiment with multiple conditions using `AND`/`OR`.
