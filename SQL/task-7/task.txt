7. **Window Functions and Ranking**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Leverage window functions to perform calculations across a set of rows.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Write a query using window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, or `DENSE_RANK()` to assign ranks (e.g., rank employees by salary within each department).
    - Use `PARTITION BY` to define groups and `ORDER BY` to specify the ranking order.
    - Experiment with other window functions like `LEAD()` or `LAG()` to access adjacent row values.
