10. **Comprehensive Database Design, Optimization, and Advanced FeaturesObjective:Requirements:**
    - Design a normalized database schema for a complex business scenario (e.g., an eCommerce platform) and implement advanced SQL features to ensure performance, data integrity, and automation.
    - **Schema Design:**
        - Design and create multiple related tables (e.g., `Products`, `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`) with proper primary and foreign keys, unique constraints, and normalization practices.
    - **Indexing and Performance:**
        - Analyze query performance and apply indexing strategies to optimize frequently executed queries.
    - **Triggers:**
        - Implement triggers to enforce business rules automatically (e.g., update inventory levels upon order insertion, log changes to critical tables).
    - **Transactions:**
        - Use transactions (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency during multi-step operations (e.g., order processing where multiple tables are updated).
    - **Views and Materialized Views (Optional):**
        - Create views to simplify complex joins and aggregations.
        - Optionally, design materialized views if your SQL dialect supports them to cache expensive query results.
    - **Documentation and Testing:**
        - Document your schema and SQL scripts.
        - Write test queries to demonstrate that all constraints, triggers, and transactions work as intended.
