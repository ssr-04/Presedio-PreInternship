5. **Subqueries and Nested Queries**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Use subqueries to filter or compute values within a main query.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Write a query that uses a subquery in the `WHERE` clause (e.g., select employees whose salary is above the departmentâ€™s average salary).
    - Alternatively, use subqueries in the `SELECT` list to compute dynamic columns.
    - Understand the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
