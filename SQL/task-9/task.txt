9. **Stored Procedures and User-Defined Functions**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Encapsulate business logic using stored procedures and functions.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Create a stored procedure that accepts parameters (e.g., a date range) and returns a result set (such as total sales within that range).
    - Write a scalar or table-valued user-defined function that performs a calculation (e.g., calculates a discount or bonus based on input parameters).
    - Test the procedure and function by calling them and verifying their outputs.
