1. **Creating and Populating Tables**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Set up a simple table, insert data, and retrieve that data using basic queries.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Use `CREATE TABLE` to define a table (e.g., `Employees` or `Products`) with appropriate data types and constraints.
    - Populate the table using `INSERT INTO` with multiple rows of sample data.
    - Execute a basic `SELECT * FROM TableName;` query to verify the data insertion.
