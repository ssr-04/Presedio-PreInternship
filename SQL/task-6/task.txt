    **Objective:**
    
    - Manipulate and query data based on date and time values.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Use built-in date functions (e.g., `DATEDIFF`, `DATEADD`, or your SQL dialectâ€™s equivalent) to calculate intervals or adjust dates.
    - Write a query to filter records based on date ranges (e.g., orders placed within the last 30 days).
    - Format date outputs if necessary using functions like `CONVERT` or `TO_CHAR`.
