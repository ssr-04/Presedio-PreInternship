3. **Simple Aggregation and Grouping**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Summarize data using aggregate functions and grouping.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Write a query that uses aggregate functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, or `AVG()` to calculate totals or averages.
    - Use the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate data by a specific column (e.g., count the number of employees per department).
    - Optionally, filter grouped results using the `HAVING` clause.
