4. **Multi-Table JOINs**
    
    **Objective:**
    
    - Combine data from two related tables using JOIN operations.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Create two related tables (e.g., `Customers` and `Orders`) with a foreign key relationship.
    - Write an `INNER JOIN` query to retrieve combined information (e.g., customer names along with their order details).
    - Experiment with other types of joins such as `LEFT JOIN` to understand how missing matches are handled.
