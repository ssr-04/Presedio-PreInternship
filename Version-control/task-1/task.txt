    **Objective:**
    
    - Initialize a new Git repository.
    - Create a few files and commit them.
    - Create a new branch, make changes, and merge it back to the main branch.
    
    **Requirements:**
    
    - Use `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` to start your repository.
    - Create a branch using `git branch` or `git checkout -b` and switch between branches.
    - Merge the branch back to the main branch and verify the commit history.
