**Undoing Changes and Reverting Commits**
    
**Objective:**

- Experiment with undoing changes in your working directory and commits.

**Requirements:**

- Modify a tracked file and use `git checkout -- <file>` (or `git restore`) to undo changes.
- Make a commit, then use `git revert` or `git reset` to see how you can undo a commit safely.
- Explain the differences between these approaches.
