**Comprehensive Workflow with Forced Pushes and RecoveryObjective:Requirements:**
- Simulate an advanced Git scenario that includes forced pushes, recovering lost commits, and a multi-branch workflow.
- Create a repository with multiple branches representing features, bug fixes, and releases.
- Simulate a scenario where a forced push (`git push --force`) is required (for example, after rewriting history with an interactive rebase).
- Use `git reflog` to locate and recover lost commits after a mistaken force push.
- Document each step, explaining how and why forced pushes should be handled with care, and how `git reflog` can be a lifesaver.
- Discuss best practices for collaborating with teams when rewriting history and using force pushes.
