**Using Git Hooks for Automated Checks**

**Objective:**

- Set up a Git hook to run scripts (like linters or tests) before commits are finalized.

**Requirements:**

- Create a `pre-commit` hook in the `.git/hooks` directory.
- Write a simple script (e.g., a shell script or Node script) that runs a linter or a unit test.
- Ensure that if the tests or linting fail, the commit is aborted.
- Document how Git hooks can improve code quality in collaborative projects.
