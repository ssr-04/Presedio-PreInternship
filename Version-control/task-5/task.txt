**Interactive Rebasing for Clean Commit History**

**Objective:**

- Use interactive rebase to tidy up your commit history.

**Requirements:**

- Create a series of commits (some with minor changes or typos in commit messages).

- Explain how squashing helps in cleaning up commit history before merging into a main branch.
