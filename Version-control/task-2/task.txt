**Using .gitignore and Tracking Files**

**Objective:**

- Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files or directories.
- Verify that ignored files are not tracked by Git.

**Requirements:**

- Create a `.gitignore` file with patterns (e.g., ignoring log files or temporary files).
- Add files that match and do not match the ignore patterns.
- Use `git status` to confirm which files are being tracked.
